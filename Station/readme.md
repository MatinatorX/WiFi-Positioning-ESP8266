There are two main roles that each station performing them sequentially. the first role is sniffing the target mobile device Wi-Fi packets, and the second role is sending the mean rssi value of that packets to the Server.
In the sniffing role each station will pick only the data packets that transmitted from mobile device to a specific AP.

The stations should be placed in a form that commensurate with work area.
